yesteday

yesterday, all my troubles seems so faraway.
now it looks as though they're here to stay,
oh, i believe in yesterday

suddeny, i'm not half the man i used to be
there's a shadow hanging over me.
oh, yesterday came suddeny

why she had to go i don't know show would'n say
i said something wrong, now i long for yesterday

yesterday, love was sucn an easy game to play
no i need a place to hide away.
oh i believe in yesterday.
